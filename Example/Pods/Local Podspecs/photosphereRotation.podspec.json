  "description": "A spherical panorama that uses an equirectangular projection can be rotated by converting the uv coodinate to spherical coordinate system and then to cartesian. The coordinates are appled by a 3x3 rotation matrix according to roll, yaw and pitch. Everything is then converted back to uv and sampled from the original texture.",
